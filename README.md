# wren-test
A testing framework for Wren

A good README is still a work in progress. For now the best way to get started it to look through the tests I've written for the library in `test/src`.

### Running Tests

These instructions are for running the metatests for the library.

1. `git submodule init`
2. `git submodule update`
3. Assuming Wren is on your path run `wren tests.wren` from the root of `wren-test` and you should see the results.
